/* Mysql Pool */

In Node.js, mysql.createPool is a method provided by the mysql or mysql2 package that creates a pool of connections to a MySQL database. 
A connection pool is a collection of database connections that can be reused to handle multiple queries more efficiently 
without the overhead of opening and closing connections frequently.
