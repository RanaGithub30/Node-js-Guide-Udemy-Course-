/* What is Sequelize? */

Sequelize is a powerful Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for Node.js, which allows developers to interact with databases 
such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and Microsoft SQL Server using JavaScript. Sequelize abstracts the raw SQL queries and provides 
a higher-level API for working with database models, relationships, and queries in a more intuitive and object-oriented way.
