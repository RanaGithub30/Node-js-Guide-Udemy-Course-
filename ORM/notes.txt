/* What is Sequelize? */

Sequelize is a powerful Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for Node.js, which allows developers to interact with databases 
such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and Microsoft SQL Server using JavaScript. Sequelize abstracts the raw SQL queries and provides 
a higher-level API for working with database models, relationships, and queries in a more intuitive and object-oriented way.

/** install the package **/

npm i --save sequelize

/** Also we need to install mysql/other db package as well **/

npm i mysql2

/* app.js - relation description */

// Defines a relationship where each Product belongs to a single User (foreign key in the Product table)
Product.belongsTo(User, {
  
  // Adds foreign key constraints to ensure data integrity (i.e., no invalid foreign key references)
  constraints: true,
  
  // Specifies that if a User is deleted, all related Products will also be deleted (cascading deletion)
  onDelete: 'CASCADE'  
});
